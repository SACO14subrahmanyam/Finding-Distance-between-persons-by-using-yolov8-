# Real-time Person Detection and Tracking with YOLOv5 and SORT

This code demonstrates how to use the YOLOv5 model from the Ultralytics library to detect and track "person" objects in a live video stream from a webcam. It uses the SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm for tracking.

## Requirements

- Python 
- OpenCV
- cvzone
- numpy
- Ultralytics
- SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone :https://github.com/SACO14subrahmanyam/Finding-Distance-between-persons-by-using-yolov8-

## Usage

1.Run the main.py script to start the real-time detection and tracking.


2. The program will open a window showing the live video stream from your webcam. Detected persons will be highlighted with bounding boxes, and their IDs will be displayed for tracking. Inter-person distances will also be calculated and displayed.

Press q to quit the program.
